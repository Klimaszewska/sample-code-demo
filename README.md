# sample-code-demo - A sample portfolio repository


This is a sample repository I use when learning Java on my own. It focuses on Java, Maven and JSP - I want to build a JSP page with dynamically displayed content. The content will include examples of employee entries (e.g. id, name, surname and similar information), methods to search the entires and forms to add employee-related information.

**So far I have used the following:**
* the Builder design pattern
* basic JSP handling
* Maven support.

**More to be added soon!**

**Other repositories**
Please refer to my other repository (LegalEnglishFlashcards) to see samples of my code for Android.
